# Persistent KV store

Implementation of core distributed systems concepts through two projects:

## Project 1: Persistent Key-Value Store
- Memcached-inspired TCP server with file-system persistence
- Supports basic `get`/`set` operations with protocol compliance
- Concurrency handling with random delay simulation
- Client testing framework

## Project 2: Totally Ordered Broadcast
- Implementation of Lamport timestamp-based ordering
- Middleware layer for message sequencing
- Proof of correctness and test cases

### Features
- Cross-platform compatibility (SICE Linux servers)
- Makefile-driven build system
- Detailed test cases for both assignments
